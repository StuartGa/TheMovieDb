##  :notebook: Missing Specs

-[Filters]:
In this case, I use the method GET /movie/now_playing to request the list  https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing
and filter with chips https://material.io/components/chips#choice-chips 
For popular movies, I use the method GET/movie/popular to request the list https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies
and filter with chips https://material.io/components/chips#choice-chips
then need listen the changes on the chips to request and prepare the fragments lifecycle and present the mutable data
