### Project Details
In the making of this movies app, I developed it using the APIs presented in TheMovieDB, when we log in to the application, we first encounter the main page. Here, the popular and upcoming movies are listed and when we click, we get the details of the movie. We reach the movies with the most votes from the tab next to it. By coming to the search option, we can search the movies database. And finally, we can go into details and see the movies we have added to favorites.
### How Can I Use
